# SortingAlgorithms
A collection of some sorting algorithms I've tried implementing in Python
## Algorithms:
- BOGO sort: Not really a 'sorting' algorithm, but sorta funny nonetheless. May never actually finish
- Quicksort: It is what it says
- Mergesort: The merge function may not be as efficient as it could be, but it does work!
